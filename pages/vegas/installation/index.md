In order to execute a simulation using 𝕍egas, two executables are available for Linux 32/64 bits and Windows 7 (or later) operating systems. However, 𝕍egas can be built on Ubuntu 14.* and 16.* operating systems.

## Linux and Windows executables

Please find the links for download the executables files for linux and windows here:

With these files, you do not need to compile 𝕍egas from source files.

- **Linux**: Just move that file to the /usr/bin path in order to execute 𝕍egas from any path. It is possible that you require sudo permissions in order to move, or copy, 𝕍egas executable to the root system. 
- **Windows**: You should execute the *install_vegas.exe* file in order to install 𝕍egas to the Program Files folder. The 𝕍egas folder is added to the path in the enviromental variables and, for this reason, you can execute 𝕍egas from any path from a CMD. It is possible that you need to deactivate the antivirus software. We are working in add a sign to the *install_vegas.exe* for be more secure to the windows system.

## Building 𝕍egas on Ubuntu

In order to build and install 𝕍egas on Ubuntu 14.* and 16.* operating systems, it is required to install the libraries of [HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/), [JSON](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/JsonCpp) and g++. HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and managing data. HDF5 is built for fast I/O processing and storage. 𝕍egas uses HDF5 because the results output file, which stores the history of the simulation, is usually very large. If the simulation results were stored in plain text, the output file could have a size of several gigabytes. However, using HDF5, the output file size is in the order of megabytes. Aso, JSON is a very useful and simple format to input the initial parameters to the simulation.

To install HDF5, JSON and g++, it is necessary to get the libhdf5-dev, libjsoncpp-dev and g++ libraries, which can be done by typing the following command on a terminal

```bash
sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev libhdf5-dev g++
```

Moreover, to compile the files, cmake (version > 3.5.1) needs to be installed. By default, Ubuntu 14.* and 16.* have in their repositories a valid version of cmake. To install cmake, run

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

To check the version of cmake, run

```bash
cmake --version
```

At this point, all the dependencies required to install 𝕍egas are installed. Now, download 𝕍egas from the master branch [here](https://github.com/jdalzatec/vegas/archive/master.zip), unzip and ```cd``` to the respective folder. If you run ```ls```, you should get the following output

```bash
analyzers  code  compilers  Dockerfile  executables  README.md
```

where **analyzers**, **code**, **compilers** and **executables** are folders and ~Readme.md~ and ~Dockerfile~ are files. To build 𝕍egas with ```cmake```, ```cd``` to **compilers/linux/** and create a folder named build, ```cd``` to this new folder, run ```cmake ..```, and then run ```make```. All of this can be done by just running the following command

```bash
mkdir compilers/linux/build && cd compilers/linux/build && cmake .. && make
```

The following output should be visualized

```bash

```

Once this process ends, in the **build** folder some files and a folder should have been created, along with a executable file named 𝕍egas. This file is the executable used to run the simulations in 𝕍egas. You can place this file in all the folders where you are going to run a simulation. However, it is better place the 𝕍egas executable in the ```/usr/bin/``` folder, such that 𝕍egas can be executed anywhere. To do this, run ```sudo make install``` and 𝕍egas will be placed in the ```/usr/bin/``` folder.

If everything went well, when you run the command ```vegas``` in a terminal, a message like this should appear

    <img src="output.png" alt="Image"/>
</center>

At this point, you just need a JSON input file with the simulation parameters, along with the sample files, to run a simulation using 𝕍egas.
