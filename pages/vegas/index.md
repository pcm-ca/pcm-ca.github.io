𝕍egas is an open-source software package that provides the required tools to build, simulate and analyze magnetic systems. 𝕍egas is hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com/jdalzatec/vegas).

The main features of 𝕍egas are the following:

* Magnetic systems are described by the classical Heisenberg model, and simulations are carried out using the Monte Carlo method.
* The building and simulation of a great variety of magnetic systems, with different structural and magnetic characteristics, can be made with high flexibility.
* The history of the simulation is stored, which allows to study the dynamic and static behavior from a single simulation. 
* Temperature/field evolution of the magnetic configuration of the system can be computed and visualized. 
* 𝕍egas can be run directly on Linux 32/64 bits and Windows 8 (or later) operating systems. 
 
The model and method, installation, system building, simulation and data analysis processes of 𝕍egas, along with some tutorials, can be found in the next sections:
