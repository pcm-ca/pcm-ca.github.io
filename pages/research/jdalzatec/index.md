abstract: "The core/shell nanoparticles have attracted much interest in the last years because their interesting coupling in the interface. These heterostructures can be built thermically stable and with high anisotropy. For this reason, they have hysteresis loops well defined. In this way, they could be employed like permanent magnets."

This is the master thesis project, named **Influence of interfacial roughness on the magnetic behavior of core/shell nanoparticles**, of the master student Juan David Alzate Cardona ([jdalzatec](/people/jdalzatec/)). This can be downloaded [here](proyecto.pdf).
