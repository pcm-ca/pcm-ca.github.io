Since the 1970s the application of physics to social situations has been an issue of interest to the scientific community. This branch of physics applies laws and theories to societal behavior at the collective level. These behaviors emerge from the interactions that occur between people. With the present work is carried out an investigation about the scientific community formed from the publications of articles in indexed journals.

As a first step, to give an introduction to this thesis project, a brief account will be made of the origin of sociophysics and its field of application. Subsequently, we will talk about the social system we selected to carry out this study, which are a networks of coauthorship. We will talk about the importance and the reason for carrying out this research and its contributions to science. The work that gave rise to socio-physics, which analyzes the state of strike in a plant based on critical phenomena of physics, will be exposed. Finally, the main aspects of the work to be developed during the thesis will be presented.
