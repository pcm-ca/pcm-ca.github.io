The effects of the non-linear Hall drift on the evolution of the magnetic field in neutron stars have been subject of research during last decades. The expected order of magnitude of the magnetic fields of these objects can make this effect important for the dynamics and eventual decay of the magnetic field. In particular, the Hall drift is relevant in the solid crust of, where the ions are remain fixed and the current is carried out by electrons. Several authors have made theoretical research progress in this direction and have found analytical configurations which are solutions of the linear term of the induction equation (Ohmic modes). However, a general stability study of these solutions is still required. As a result of this idea, I study the stability of these configurations against arbitrary non-axisymetric (3D) perturbations. In order to resolve the induction equation, I use a spectral numerical code that decomposes the magnetic field in multipole components, and I carry out numerical simulations of the evolution of the perturbed Omic modes including the effects of Hall drift and Ohmic diffusion. Besides, with the final purpose to check the stability or instability of these Ohmic modes, I study the transfer of energy between the poloidal and toroidal multipoles, caused by their non-linear coupling through the Hall effect. The results of this research is routed to increase our understanding of the magnetic phenomena in the crust of neutron stars.
