This tutorial consists on the lecture notes of a small introductory curse that was taught in March of 2017 by mathematician **Miguel González Duque**, a former member of PCM. This course is an introduction to [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) taylored for students of mathematics (or any other STEM career) which are already familiar with some concepts of programming (like conditionals or loops). All the notes were done (and are generated by) [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) using the python3 distribution of [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview).

The notes of the course are available only in spanish, and can be downloaded from:

- [Lecture 3](Clase+3.pdf)
- [Lecture 4](Clase+4.pdf)
